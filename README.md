# Recoder
Bulk Music file transcoder

This Application is a small program which I wrote for my own purposes. In my case, I have music stored in .FLAC format, 
but I need .MP3 format in my MP3 player. Rather than painstakingly convert each file individually, 
I created this small program for the purpose.

Effectively, you give it a input directory, an output directory, and a set of file masks, and it will re-encode all the files to .MP3 format.

Currently it is limited in it's abilities based on what I've needed it to do for me so far. But the program may be found useful later.

It makes use of BASS.NET and LAME for dealing with audio files. 

This program is described and discussed in my Blog post here:
